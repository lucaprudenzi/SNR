# SNR
This project has the aim of compute the amplitude, the frequency and the signal-to-noise ratio for Ligo gravitational wave sources during inspiral phase.
It is constitued of a python module, snr_module.py, 

![GW151226](/images/gw151226.png "GW151226")

![Terminal_output](/images/terminal.png "Terminal_output")

Several examples have been provided to show the module in action. Use template.py for new test. See example directory.
The parameters that can be changed are 
- masses of the binary
- luminosity distance
- redshift 
- angle between line of sight and angular moment of the binary
- angles that describe the position in the sky of the binary

# SNR
snr_module.py python module computes the amplitude, the frequency and the signal-to-noise ratio for Ligo gravitational wave sources during inspiral phase.

Three examples are provided using GW150914, GW151226 and GW170817 parameters to show the module in action. It is possibile to modify masses, luminosity distance, redshift and the angles respect to the interferometer reference frame
